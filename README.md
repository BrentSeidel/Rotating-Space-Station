# Rotating-Space-Station
I was curious about how air pressure would change as a function of distance from the center in a rotating space
station.  Being unable to find any answers on the web, I set out to figure out what the answer would be myself.  This
paper is the result.  Included should be all the files necessary to reproduce the results.

So far, this hasn't been (as far as I know) reviewed by anyone.  If someone would like to check my work and give me
some feedback, I'd appreciate it.
